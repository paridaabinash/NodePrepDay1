// 5)Explain min 5 status codes gets used in Backend development
// Ans->  HTTP status codes are divided into 5 “classes”. These are groupings of responses that have similar or related meanings. 
//  Knowing what they are can help you quickly determine the general substance of a status code before you go about looking up its specific meaning.

//  The five classes include:
//  100s: Informational codes indicating that the request initiated by the browser is continuing.
//  200s: Success codes returned when browser request was received, understood, and processed by the server.
//  300s: Redirection codes returned when a new resource has been substituted for the requested resource.
//  400s: Client error codes indicating that there was a problem with the request.
//  500s: Server error codes indicating that the request was accepted, but that an error on the server prevented the fulfillment of the request.


// 6)Difference between HTTP and HTTPS

//  In HTTP, URL begins with “http://” whereas URL starts with “https://”
//  HTTP uses port number 80 for communication and HTTPS uses 443
//  HTTP is considered to be insecure and HTTPS is secure
//  HTTP Works at Application Layer and HTTPS works at Transport Layer
//  HTTP does not require any certificates and HTTPS needs SSL Certificates
//  HTTP speed is faster than HTTPS and HTTPS speed is slower than HTTP
